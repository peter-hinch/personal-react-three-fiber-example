# Type 3 Volkswagen configurator using React Three Fiber

The Volkswagen Type 3 is a vehicle that is near to my heart. As a personal project and a fun way to learn some more about Three JS, I have been building this product configurator. I hope to add some more options as I have time. Thanks for taking a look!

## I'd like to see the app

The 3D model for this project was built in Blender.
